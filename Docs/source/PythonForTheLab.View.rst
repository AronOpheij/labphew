PythonForTheLab\.View
=====================
All the files related to the GUI should be placed within the View package. This is the third leg of the
MVC design pattern. If the Model is properly built, the Views are relatively simple PyQt objects. It is
important to point out that if there is any logic of the experiment that goes into the view, the code is
going to become harder to share, unless it is for the exact same purpose.
